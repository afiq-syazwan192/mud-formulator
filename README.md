# Mud Formulator

A drilling mud formulation calculator application built with React and TypeScript. This application helps engineers and technicians calculate drilling fluid compositions and properties.

## Features

- Calculate mud formulations for different mud types
- Add and manage drilling fluid products
- Real-time calculation of product concentrations
- Support for both water-based and oil-based muds
- Dynamic product addition with specific gravity calculations
- Concentration inputs in lb/bbl and % by volume

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Material-UI (MUI) v5
- Node.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/afiq-syazwan192/mud-formulator.git
cd mud-formulator
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Select the mud type (Water-Based or Oil-Based)
2. Enter the desired mud weight
3. Add products with their concentrations
4. Click "Calculate" to see the results
5. Use "Reset All" to clear all inputs
6. Use "Reset Values" to clear only concentration values
